Task:

193.16.20.35/29

What is the Network IP, number of hosts, range of IP addresses and broadcast IP from this subnet?

# Solution

To get the number of host bits: 32 - 29 = 3 host bits

To get total address per network: 2 ** 3 (host bits) = 8 addresses per network

List of available networks: 8 - 16 - 24 - 32 - 40 - 48 - 56
# Network
Closest network to given IP = Network IP address: 193:16:20:32
# Range 
First available host IP: 192:16:20:33
                .
                .
                .
Last available host IP: 192:16:20:38
# Broadcast
Broadcast IP address: 192:16:20:39

# Hosts
Total number of host IP address: 6
